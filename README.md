# Py Krovetz

This is a Python wrapper for [Krovetz Stemmer C++ library](https://sourceforge.net/p/lemur/wiki/KrovetzStemmer). It uses Cython to build a wrapper and allow access to the cpp object in python.

## Usage

```python
import krovetz
ks = krovetz.PyKrovetzStemmer()
ks.stem('walked')
```

## Installation

### Requirements

#### Python
All the requirements are handled automatic. However, tests have been made on Linux GNU and OSX using Python 3.5-3.6. Notice that using python 3.5 and macos might not work as some compilation of python 3.5 are linked to older versions of OpenSSL. This affects the communication of `pip` and PyPI website when retrieving libraries. If you plan to use this combination, make sure that Python is linked to an updated version of OpenSSL.

`python -c 'import ssl; print(ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION)'`

Version should be `1.*.*`

#### C++ compiler
The actual code is of the stemmer is written in `C++`. Thus, a **`C++` compiler is needed**. Make sure you have one installed. 
We have tested `gcc` in Linux system and `clang` in MacOS. Regardless of this, other combinations and compilers might also work.

### Setup

#### PyPI
PyPI provides a ready-to-go version.

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ krovetz`

#### Git
Git repo only includes cython files (.pxd) and not the files generated by `Cython`. Therefore, if you plan to install from here, **you need to have `Cython` installed** in order to generate `C++` files. 

`pip install cython`

Then just do:

`pip install git+https://github.com/ptorrestr/py_krovetz.git`

## Development
We are using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to handle the development environment. This tool is very handy to manage different python versions and configurations.

### Import
First, import the project in your machine

`git clone https://github.com/ptorrestr/py_krovetz.git`

### Environment setup
You can install the environment needed just using the following command

`pipenv install`

Have a look on files `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` in order to check the versions of the dependencies used in our development machine.

### Testing
Test can be run using the environment defined by `pipenv`.

`pienv run python setup.py test`
